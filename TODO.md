# TODO

- [ ] compile and run `adb` tests
- [ ] move `compile_proto_files` to `src/Makefile` as the targets cannot be resolved on first run (`.proto` files aren't present yet)
- [ ] reduce binary size
- [ ] move compiled libraries / binaries from root Makefile to `$(OUT_DIR)` for easier referencing
- [ ] also build `fastboot` ?
