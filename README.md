# adb-proj
# adb 1.0.41 (x86_64 and arm64)
the project is build adb from souce code. the adb verson is 1.0.41.  code base on android10-release code. 
i can build the source on linux x86_64 system, and arm64 system success！

there I didn't provide a arm cross compile environment. but only the release binary is provided.(because i build it on a pure linux arm os system（such as MacBook Air M1）, so i don't need cross compile environment :). If you can, please help modify&create a cross compiling environment、makefile to improve the project )
