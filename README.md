# adb-standalone-build

This project aims to build a standalone `adb` binary on Linux from downloaded sources (more trustable than source code copy-pasta and better maintainability).

The initial goal was to build the binary for the Raspberry Pi 4b (`aarch64` processor), but it should be architecture-independent since it builds everything from sources (developed on my `x86-64` laptop and then built without any issue on the RPi4b).

## Requirements

- `clang`
- `cmake` (to build Protobuf & BoringSSL)
- `golang-go` (to build BoringSSL)
- `libunwind-dev` (optional, to test BoringSSL build)
- `autoconf` (to build libusb)
- `libtool` (to build libusb)
- `libudev1` (to build libusb)
- `libudev-dev` (to build libusb)

For Debian / Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install clang cmake golang-go libunwind-dev autoconf libtool libudev1 libudev-dev
```

## Tested on

- `x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 5.15.0-60-generic`
