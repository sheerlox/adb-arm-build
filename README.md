# adb-standalone-build

This project aims to build a standalone `adb` binary on Linux from downloaded sources (more trustable than source code copy-pasta and better maintainability).

The initial goal was to build the binary for the Raspberry Pi 4b (`aarch64` processor), but it should be architecture-independent since it builds everything from sources (developed on my `x86-64` laptop and then built without any issue on the RPi4b).

## Dependencies

- `cmake` (>= 3.10)
- `clang`
- `libstdc++-11-dev`
- `libgcc-11-dev`
- `libudev-dev`
- `libc6-dev`
- `golang-go` (to build BoringSSL)
- `pkg-config` (optional, improves BoringSSL build tests)
- `libunwind-dev` (optional, improves BoringSSL build tests)
- `autoconf` (to build libusb)
- `libtool` (to build libusb)

For Debian / Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake clang libstdc++-11-dev libgcc-11-dev libudev1 libudev-dev golang-go pkg-config libunwind-dev autoconf libtool
```

## Usage

Clone the repositories and install dependencies, then just:

```bash
cd adb-standalone-build/
make
make test
```

By default, messages are logged by each target (e.g. `Downloading adb source ...`, `Building boringssl ...`, etc...) and the commands' output is muted to follow the build more easily, but you can `tail -f error.log` to watch if anything goes wrong, or just comment the `SUPPRESS_OUTPUT` line in the root `Makefile` to get full commands output.

## Tested on

- `x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 5.15.0-60-generic` / `clang 14` / `libstdc++-dev 11.3` / `libgcc-dev 11.3` / `cmake 3.22` / `go 1.18` / `autoconf 2.71` / `libtool 2.4`
